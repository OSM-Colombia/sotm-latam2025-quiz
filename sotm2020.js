  "intro": "Welcome! This is a single-player version of the trivia quiz that was played at the <a href=\"https://2020.stateofthemap.org/\" target=\"_blank\">State of the Map 2020</a> conference. Some answers might have gotten stale, so this might be a fun history lesson for you. For each question, choose one answer and see how many people did the same choice. Unlike the real-time version, there are no time-limits, but please don't google questions: that would take the fun out. And that's what this quiz is for: some knowledge and some fun!\n\nThank you to Frederik Ramm, Sergey Golubev, and Trudy Namitala for helping with the questions!",

  "afterword": "Yay, you have finished the quiz! Hope you have learnt something interesting about OpenStreetMap. Now back to mapping and helping other people map, I guess. Thank you!",
